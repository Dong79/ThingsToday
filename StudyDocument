A new start for me 
The morning just passed so fast. I didn't catch the time of my morning today. 
I AC three leetcode problems in the afternoon. 
I went to church at night. A great evening with some nice guys.
So I have to finish my homework tomorrow.
Hope everything will become better and better.
